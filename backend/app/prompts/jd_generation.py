   - Main title with single # (Job Title)
   - Section headers with ## (Overview, Responsibilities, etc.)
   - Bullet points with - for lists
   - Bold text with ** for company name and important terms

2. Include ALL these sections in order:
   - Title (# Job Title)

   - Key Responsibilities (5-7 specific, actionable bullet points)
   - Required Qualifications (8-12 bullets including all must-have skills)

   - Benefits and Perks (4-6 bullets)
